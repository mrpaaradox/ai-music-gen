# Mm… yeah
# Slow lights, summer air

# [verse]
# We don't need words tonight,
# Your eyes say more in silence,
# Barefoot dancing in the dark,
# Every step feels weightless.

# City breathing, warm and low,
# Moonlight on your shoulder,
# Time moves slow when you're this close,
# I just wanna hold ya.

# [pre-chorus]
# When you lean a little nearer,
# Every doubt disappears,
# Heartbeat sync, getting clearer,
# This moment's all we hear.

# [chorus]
# Move slow, don't let go,
# Feel the rhythm in your skin,
# Every touch, every glow,
# Pulls me deeper, pulls me in.

# Say it soft, say it low,
# Like a secret in my ear,
# If tonight is all we own,
# Let it last forever here.

# [verse]
# Ocean humming through the night,
# Salt and neon colors,
# Laughing like the world is light,
# Nothing else can touch us.

# Your shadow dancing next to mine,
# Fire under water,
# If this ends at sunrise time,
# I'd still go a little farther.

# [pre-chorus]
# Every breath feels like a promise,
# Every look feels true,
# If the stars fall out of focus,
# I still see you.

# [chorus]
# Move slow, don't let go,
# Feel the rhythm in your skin,
# Every touch, every glow,
# Pulls me deeper, pulls me in.

# Say it soft, say it low,
# Like a secret in my ear,
# If tonight is all we own,
# Let it last forever here.

# [bridge]
# Close your eyes, count to three,
# Let the night take over,
# Lose the fear, come with me,
# We don't need no closure.

# Ooh… yeah
# Right here, right now

# [final chorus]
# Move slow, don't let go,
# Feel the rhythm when we breathe,
# Every beat, every tone,
# Feels like where we're meant to be.

# Say it soft, say it low,
# Even if it disappears,
# If tonight is all we own,
# Let it live forever here.

# [outro]
# Mm…
# Forever here
